- 0.1.6

  - Make ffmpeg output less verbose.
  - Don't do "slow" video conversions.

- 0.1.8

  - Fix single quoting.

- 0.1.9

  - Add different encoder support.

- 0.1.10

  - Fix underscore issue.


- 0.1.11

  - Add force (re-encode) option.

- 0.1.12

  - Fix preference, shorten string.

- 0.1.13

  - Put the name of the temporary file at the end of output, so we don't have to scroll all the way to the top
    to find out what it is.

  - Plant a flag when we've touched a file.

    - For whole file:
      - MM_TOOL_ENCODED=true|false       Set to true if any part of the file was transcoded.
      - MM_TOOL_WRITTEN=true|false       Set to true if the file was written by mm_tool, for example, possibly
                                         nothing was transcoded, but streams were dropped or added. If EVERY stream
                                         is copy ONLY, then we don't apply this.

    - For streams:
    - MM_TOOL_ENCODED_STREAM=true|false  Set to true if the stream is transcoded.
